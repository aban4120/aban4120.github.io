      <description>Abhishek Bansal Introduction
The datasets I have chosen were pulled from the gapminder database. The gapminder database compiles different statistics (i.e. income, GDP, population, etc.) about different countries around the world. The first dataset contains information about the life expectancy in multiple countries from 2000-2015. The second dataset contains information about the child mortality in multiple countries from 2000-2015. The third dataset contains information about the fertility rates in multiple countries from 2000-2015.</description>
